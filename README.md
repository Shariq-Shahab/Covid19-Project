# Covid19-Project
In this repository,I used Microsoft SQL Server to analyze COVID-19 data and gain insights into the pandemic's impact.
With these queries and extracted data I created a Tableau dashboard that visualizes the spread and impact of COVID-19 in different regions. 
The data used in the SQL and dashboard is sourced from the COVID-19 Data Website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and updated daily.

Through this project, I gained experience in querying, joining, and transforming large datasets using SQL.I also developed skills in creating visualizations to communicate my findings effectively.The dashboard features interactive maps, charts, and filters to help users explore the data and understand the trends via Tableau.
